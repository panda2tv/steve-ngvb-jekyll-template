EMS kind of expensive, Serve fewer countries than express and charge a little bit more. But EMS have the advantage of customs clearance for specific countries.  Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Spain, and the Netherlands have about 5-7 working days; Russia, Brazil, Ukraine, and Belarus have about 7-10 working days.

epacket:

China air mail post:

For a small package, ePacket delivery is the way to go. This delivery method was born out of an agreement with the US Post Services and Hong Kong Post, with the aim to make it easier for e-commerce entrepreneurs, like you, to ship products to the rest of the world.  

Many dropshipper asking me about the shipping question, the price depends on your products and destination country, and it changes from time to time.  Please confirm before you trying to sale. Shipping is the main part of your cost.
